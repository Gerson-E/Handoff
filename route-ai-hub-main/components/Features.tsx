            Healthcare disparities affect not only rural regions but also small and resource-limited clinics that struggle to coordinate with larger hospitals. These systems often don't know where to send patient requests and records because identity data is disconnected across incompatible Electronic Health Records. <span className="font-bold text-blue-400">Handoff</span> solves this through an essential AI incorporationâ€”leveraging verified patient identity, smart facility scoring, and explainable reasoning to automatically route every clinical order to the right destination the very first time. By eliminating data disconnection, duplication, and manual coordination, <span className="font-bold text-blue-400">Handoff</span> gives all clinics enterprise-grade intelligence and scalability, creating truly connected, equitable healthcare networks worldwide.
